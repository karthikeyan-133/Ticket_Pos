# Executive Model Fix

## Problem
The application was throwing a `TypeError: Executive.findAll is not a function` error when trying to fetch executives. This was happening because:

1. The executives route was calling `Executive.findAll()` 
2. The Executive model dynamically exports either the mock model or the Supabase model based on environment configuration
3. The mock Executive model only had a `find()` method, not a `findAll()` method
4. The Supabase Executive model had both `find()` and `findAll()` methods

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Executives Route
Modified the executives route (`server/routes/executives.js`) to:
- Check if the `findAll()` method exists on the Executive model
- If it exists, use `findAll()` (Supabase model)
- If it doesn't exist, use `find()` with appropriate filtering (mock model)
- Handle filtering differently based on which model is being used

### 2. Added findAll() Method to Mock Models
Added `findAll()` methods to all mock models for consistency:
- `server/models/mock/Executive.js`
- `server/models/mock/Ticket.js` 
- `server/models/mock/Sale.js`

Each `findAll()` method is simply an alias that calls the corresponding `find()` method.

### 3. Maintained Backward Compatibility
The changes maintain backward compatibility by:
- Not changing the existing `find()` method signatures
- Adding `findAll()` as an additional method rather than replacing `find()`
- Ensuring both mock and Supabase models have the same interface

## How It Works

When the application starts:
1. It determines whether to use the mock models or Supabase models based on environment variables
2. The executives route checks which methods are available on the Executive model
3. It calls the appropriate method (`findAll()` for Supabase, `find()` for mock)
4. Both methods return the same data structure, ensuring consistent behavior

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:
1. Starting the server with mock models (no SUPABASE_URL/SUPABASE_KEY in .env)
2. Making a GET request to `/api/executives`
3. Verifying that executives are returned without errors

The same endpoint will also work when using Supabase models in production.

## Benefits

1. **Fixed the TypeError**: The application no longer crashes when fetching executives
2. **Maintained flexibility**: Works with both mock and Supabase implementations
3. **Improved consistency**: All models now have the same interface
4. **Backward compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
