# WhatsApp Client Message Example

When a ticket is closed, the client will receive a message in the following format:

## Message Format

```

## Example Message
```

This message will appear in the client's WhatsApp chat with the system. The client will see this message as if it was sent by the support team's WhatsApp number that was used to set up the integration.
