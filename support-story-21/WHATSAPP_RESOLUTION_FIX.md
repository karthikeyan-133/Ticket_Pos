# WhatsApp Resolution Validation Fix

## Problem
The WhatsApp redirect was working, but the system was not properly checking if the resolution field had content before generating the WhatsApp message URL. This could lead to sending WhatsApp messages with empty or meaningless resolution details.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Validation (TicketDetail.tsx and EditTicket.tsx)
- Added validation to check if the resolution field has content before generating the WhatsApp message
- Show a toast notification to the user if the resolution is missing
- Prevent the WhatsApp redirect if resolution is empty or contains only whitespace

### 2. Backend Validation (notificationService.js)
- Added validation in the `generateWhatsAppMessageUrl` function to ensure the resolution field has content
- Return an error response if the resolution is missing or contains only whitespace
- Log appropriate error messages for debugging

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. In [TicketDetail.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/ticket%20system/support-story-21/src/pages/TicketDetail.tsx):
   - Added validation to check if resolution is provided before generating WhatsApp message
   - Show toast notification if resolution is missing

2. In [EditTicket.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/ticket%20system/support-story-21/src/pages/EditTicket.tsx):
   - Added validation to check if resolution is provided before generating WhatsApp message
   - Show toast notification if resolution is missing

### Backend Changes
1. In [notificationService.js](file:///c:/Users/TECHZON-17/Desktop/ticket%20system/support-story-21/server/services/notificationService.js):
   - Added validation to check if resolution is provided before generating WhatsApp message
   - Return error response if resolution is missing or contains only whitespace

## Test Results
The fix has been tested and verified:
- Tickets with resolution: WhatsApp URL generated successfully
- Tickets without resolution: Error returned, no WhatsApp redirect
- Tickets with whitespace-only resolution: Error returned, no WhatsApp redirect

## Benefits
