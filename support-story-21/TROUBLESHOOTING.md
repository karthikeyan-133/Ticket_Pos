# Troubleshooting Vercel Deployment Issues

## Current Issue
You're experiencing a network connection error: "Network error - Please check your connection and ensure the API server is running"

## What We've Already Fixed
1. Removed secret references from vercel.json
2. Removed potentially confusing vercel.env file
3. Simplified vercel.json configuration to route all API requests through the main API handler
4. Added backend testing tools
5. Committed and pushed all changes to GitHub

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify Backend Deployment
First, check if your backend API is properly deployed and accessible:

1. Visit your backend root URL directly in your browser:
   - https://ticket-pos-backend.vercel.app/
   - You should see a JSON response with "message": "Ticket System API is running!"

2. Test the health endpoint:
   - https://ticket-pos-backend.vercel.app/api/health
   - You should see a response indicating the server is running and connected to Supabase

### 2. Check Vercel Environment Variables
Make sure your backend environment variables are correctly set in Vercel:

- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Navigate to your backend project settings
- Go to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
- Ensure these variables are set:
  ```
  SUPABASE_URL=https://bnrnuddotoemwsgvlgbj.supabase.co
  SUPABASE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImJucm51ZGRvdG9lbXdzZ3ZsZ2JqIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTc1MjU0MDYsImV4cCI6MjA3MzEwMTQwNn0.bSqfeOf8LkV-4EfJxHjPiScvHy_pMpqmVAQ8vT4UuIQ
  FRONTEND_URL=https://ticket-pos.vercel.app
  ```

### 3. Test API Endpoints
Use the test page we created to verify API connectivity:

1. Visit: https://ticket-pos.vercel.app/backend-test.html
2. Click each test button to verify connectivity to different endpoints

### 4. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools and check the console for any error messages:

1. Press F12 to open developer tools
2. Go to the "Console" tab
3. Look for any error messages related to network requests or CORS issues

### 5. Verify CORS Configuration
The backend should be configured to accept requests from your frontend:

1. Check that your frontend URL (https://ticket-pos.vercel.app) is in the CORS configuration
2. Verify that the backend is sending proper CORS headers

### 6. Force Redeployment
Trigger a fresh deployment to ensure all changes are applied:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Click on the three dots next to your latest deployment
5. Select "Redeploy" and choose "Use existing Build Cache" = No

## Common Solutions

### Solution 1: Environment Variables
The most common cause of this error is missing or incorrect environment variables:

1. Ensure SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY are set in your Vercel backend project
2. Make sure there are no typos in the values
3. Verify that the Supabase credentials are still valid

### Solution 2: API Route Configuration
The simplified vercel.json configuration should resolve routing issues:

1. All API requests now go through api/index.js
2. This eliminates potential conflicts between separate API route files

### Solution 3: Network/Firewall Issues
If the backend is deployed but not accessible:

1. Check if your Vercel functions are timing out
2. Verify that your Supabase database is accessible
3. Check Vercel logs for any error messages

## Debugging Tools

### Backend Test Page
We've created a test page at https://ticket-pos.vercel.app/backend-test.html that allows you to:
- Test the root endpoint
- Test the health check endpoint
- Test the tickets endpoint

### Browser Developer Tools
Use your browser's developer tools to:
- Check network requests in the "Network" tab
- View console errors in the "Console" tab
- Inspect request/response headers

## If Issues Persist

1. Check Vercel logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify that your Supabase credentials are correct and active
3. Try creating a new Vercel project for the backend
4. Contact Vercel support with specific error details
