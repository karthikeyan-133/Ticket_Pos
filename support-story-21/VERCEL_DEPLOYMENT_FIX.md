# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
The application was failing to deploy to Vercel with the following error:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'dotenv' imported from /var/task/support-story-21/server/services/notificationService.js
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that Vercel was only installing dependencies from the root `package.json` file, but the `dotenv` package (and other server dependencies) were only listed in the `server/package.json` file.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Moved Server Dependencies to Root package.json
All server dependencies including `dotenv`, `nodemailer`, `mysql2`, `twilio`, and `serverless-http` were moved to the root `package.json` file to ensure they are available in the Vercel deployment environment.

### 2. Updated vercel.json Install Command
The `installCommand` in `vercel.json` was updated to also install dependencies from the server directory:
```json
"installCommand": "npm install && cd server && npm install"
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling in Notification Service
The notification service was updated with error handling for the dotenv import to gracefully handle cases where the package might not be available:
```javascript
// Load environment variables with error handling
try {
  const dotenv = await import('dotenv');
  dotenv.config();
  console.log('Dotenv loaded successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Dotenv not available, using process.env directly:', error.message);
}
```

## Required Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard

For the email notification system to work properly in Vercel, you need to set the following environment variables in your Vercel project dashboard:

1. `VERCEL_SMTP_HOST` - Your SMTP host (e.g., smtp.rediffmailpro.com)
2. `VERCEL_SMTP_PORT` - Your SMTP port (e.g., 587)
3. `VERCEL_SMTP_USER` - Your SMTP username (email address)
4. `VERCEL_SMTP_PASS` - Your SMTP password
5. `FROM_EMAIL` - The email address to send from

## Testing the Fix

To test that the fix works, you can:

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Use the test endpoint: `POST /api/test-email-send` with a JSON body containing:
   ```json
   {
     "toEmail": "test@example.com",
     "subject": "Test Email",
     "message": "This is a test email"
   }
   ```

## Additional Notes

- The application should now successfully deploy to Vercel without the dotenv import error
- Email notifications should work correctly when tickets are closed
- All server dependencies are now available in the Vercel environment
