# API Record Limit Fix

## Problem
Only 1000 tickets were showing in the ticket page because Supabase has a default limit of 1000 records per query. This affected all three main entities:
- Tickets API
- Executives API  
- Sales API

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Tickets API (`api/tickets.js`)
- Added `.limit(10000)` to the Supabase query to fetch up to 10,000 records
- This removes the default 1000 record limit imposed by Supabase
- Maintained all existing filtering and sorting functionality

### 2. Updated Executives API (`api/executives.js`)
- Added `.limit(10000)` to the Supabase query to fetch up to 10,000 records
- This removes the default 1000 record limit imposed by Supabase
- Maintained all existing filtering and sorting functionality

### 3. Updated Sales API (`api/sales.js`)
- Added `.limit(10000)` to the Supabase query to fetch up to 10,000 records
- This removes the default 1000 record limit imposed by Supabase
- Maintained all existing filtering and sorting functionality

## How It Works

When the frontend requests all records:
1. The API builds the appropriate Supabase query with filters and sorting
2. The `.limit(10000)` method is added to remove the default 1000 record limit
3. All matching records (up to 10,000) are returned to the frontend
4. The frontend displays all the records without pagination

## Benefits

1. **Shows All Records**: Users can now see all tickets, executives, and sales records
2. **Maintains Performance**: Still uses efficient database queries rather than multiple requests
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes
4. **Consistent Behavior**: All three entities now behave the same way

## Considerations

- The limit is set to 10,000 records which should be sufficient for most use cases
- For extremely large datasets, you might want to implement proper pagination
- The limit can be adjusted by changing the number in `.limit(10000)`

## Testing

The fix can be tested by:
1. Creating more than 1000 tickets in the database
2. Loading the tickets page
3. Verifying that all tickets are displayed
4. Testing the same with executives and sales pages

Example API call that now returns all records:
```
GET /api/tickets
```
