# API Filtering Fix

## Problem
The Vercel ticket page filters were not working because the API endpoints for tickets, executives, and sales were not implementing server-side filtering. The frontend was sending filter parameters, but the backend was ignoring them and returning all records.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Tickets API (`api/tickets.js`)
- Modified the GET all tickets endpoint (`/api/tickets`) to support server-side filtering
- Added support for the following query parameters:
  - `search`: Search across ticket number, serial number, company name, contact person, and email
  - `status`: Filter by ticket status
  - `priority`: Filter by ticket priority
  - `company`: Filter by company name
  - `serialNumber`: Filter by serial number
- Implemented proper Supabase query building with `.or()` for search functionality
- Added mock data filtering for local development
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 2. Updated Executives API (`api/executives.js`)
- Modified the GET all executives endpoint (`/api/executives`) to support server-side filtering
- Added support for the following query parameters:
  - `search`: Search across name, email, and department
  - `department`: Filter by department
  - `isActive`: Filter by active status
- Implemented proper Supabase query building
- Added mock data filtering for local development
- Maintained backward compatibility

### 3. Updated Sales API (`api/sales.js`)
- Modified the GET all sales endpoint (`/api/sales`) to support server-side filtering
- Added support for the following query parameters:
  - `search`: Search across company name, customer name, email, and product enquired
  - `statusOfEnquiry`: Filter by status of enquiry
  - `assignedExecutive`: Filter by assigned executive
- Implemented proper Supabase query building with `.or()` for search functionality
- Added mock data filtering for local development
- Maintained backward compatibility

## How It Works

When users apply filters on the frontend:
1. The frontend sends filter parameters as query strings to the API endpoints
2. The backend API parses these parameters and builds appropriate database queries
3. For Supabase implementations, the API uses `.eq()`, `.or()`, and other Supabase query methods
4. For mock implementations, the API applies JavaScript filtering to mock data
5. Results are returned to the frontend, which updates the UI

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Server-side filtering reduces the amount of data transferred
2. **Better User Experience**: Faster response times when filtering large datasets
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Works the same way in both development and production
4. **Full Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All three main entities (tickets, executives, sales) now support filtering

## Testing

The filtering can be tested by:
1. Applying filters on the tickets, executives, and sales pages
2. Verifying that only matching records are displayed
3. Checking that clearing filters shows all records
4. Testing search functionality across multiple fields

Example API calls:
```
GET /api/tickets?status=open&priority=high
GET /api/executives?department=Support&isActive=true
GET /api/sales?statusOfEnquiry=hot&assignedExecutive=Sarah%20Johnson
```
